# Car Price Prediction Dataset

The **Car Price Prediction** dataset is a diverse collection of data on various car models and their attributes, sourced from multiple online platforms. It is designed to support researchers, data scientists, and machine learning practitioners in building regression models to predict car prices and analyze automotive market trends.

## 📁 Dataset Overview

This dataset includes a variety of features commonly used in car price prediction models, such as:

- Car brand and model
- Year of manufacture
- Fuel type
- Transmission type
- Engine size
- Mileage
- Number of doors
- Body type
- Price

These attributes provide a solid foundation for exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and the development of predictive models.

## 🧠 Use Cases

- Regression analysis for price prediction
- Exploratory analysis of automotive market trends
- Feature importance evaluation
- Educational purposes (data science and machine learning projects)
- Business insights for dealerships or car valuation platforms

## 📊 Example Analyses

- How does mileage impact car value?
- Which brands depreciate the fastest?
- Are automatic cars more expensive on average than manual ones?

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

You can use tools and libraries such as:

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Machine learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, XGBoost)
